* Optimisation
** Information base
IB are just plain lists now, which works but will probably not scale
very well as far as searching goes.

An alternative could be using an indexed data structure. Request
predicate creation should probably be a GF and method selection would
be on IB type, or the predicate could a funcallable object that
exposes information needed to use the indexes.
